Extracted, cleaned up (read: probably broken) version of winpthreads from the mingw-w64 project.

Added a CMake build file and cleaned out the rest. You can do the cmake thing, or you can just add the source files directly to your project.

Basically I created this to be able to use the pthreads api from msvc, and didn't want to have the whole mingw-w64 stuff cramping my style. Fixed a handful of warnings and weird code. Test were nuked because they didn't run anyway.

Livin' on the edge. Probably not a great idea to use for production code.

Theoretically "upgrading" to the latest upstream stuff from mingw-w64 is a copy-paste procedure (include and source directories). Will try to keep this up to date if possible.

Would definitely welcome pull requests adding the tests back and getting them runing. (Along with anything else you might want to add).



p.s. Some of these changes might be worth contributing back. A lot of the code already had some bits and pieces in place for working with MSVC so I assume that MSVC support was intended at least at some time in the past. It just clearly hasn't been maintained.

I'm currently using this with the latest and greatest MSVC 2017 release with warning-free compilation :)
